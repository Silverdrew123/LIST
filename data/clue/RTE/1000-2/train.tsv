The Miss Megan was pushing barge IBR 234, which was tied along the starboard side of barge Athena 106, en route to a pile-driving location. Athena Construction did not require its crews to pin mooring spuds (vertical steel shafts extending through wells in the bottom of the boat and used for mooring) securely in place on its barges and consequently this had not been done. During the journey, the aft spud on the Athena 106 released from its fully raised position. The spud dropped into the water and struck a submerged, high-pressure natural gas pipeline. The resulting gas released ignited and created a fireball that engulfed the towing vessel and both barges. The master of the towing vessel and four barge workers were killed.

1828	Any taxpayer earning over £150,000 will no longer enjoy higher-rate tax relief, which is considered a substantial incentive to save for wealthy workers. From April 2011, anyone who earns £200,000 a year, for example, and pays the typical amount of 6 per cent of their salary into their company pension scheme will lose out on £200 a month or £2,400 a year.  Alistair Darling, when he announced the move in the Budget, insisted that just 1.5 per cent of taxpayers - the equivalent of about 450,000 people - would be hit, but experts argued that it would significantly damage the already beleaguered pensions industry, and cause many savers to think twice about investing in a pension.

Other scientists, however, do not believe that meteoritic chemicals played such a significant role.

1134	Scientists have uncovered soft bone tissue of a Tyrannosaurus Rex known as MOR 1125, found in a sandstone formation in Montana. MOR 1125 was 18 years old when it died, 65 million years ago. Similar tissue of a dinosaur has never been found before, as all remains found until now were fosilized. The tissue still contains microscopic structures resembling bloodvessels and cells. The comparison between the structures found in the T-rex and a modern day Ostrich shows a remarkable similarity. The results have been duplicated with an 80-million-year-old hadrosaur and two other tyrannosaurs. The discovery was reported in today's issue of Science. Results similar to the popular film "Jurassic park" are unlikely, as the recovery of DNA from the tissue is improbable. The results remain astounding, however, and tests with antibodies that react to collagen shows the tissue may still contain proteins. "Ultimately if we could establish chemical composition, we would have insights into all kinds of things: diet, sexual maturity, whether the specimen is the male or female.", paleontologist Hans-Dieter Sues said.

In November 2005, Nottingham pleaded guilty to fraud and influence peddling and received a conditional sentence of two years less a day. "Mr. Nottingham was not only involved in fraudulent activity, he compounded that offence by not reporting that income," said Crown attorney Michael Foote at a sentencing hearing earlier this week.
